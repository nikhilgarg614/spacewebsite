                    alt="The Moon">
                <p>Earth has just one moon – a rocky, cratered place, roughly a
                    quarter the size of Earth and an average of 238,855 miles
                    away. The Moon can be seen with the naked eye most nights as
                    it traces its 27-day orbit around our planet. It’s no wonder
                    that we are fascinated. The Moon is Earth’s only natural
                    satellite and one that we can easily see most nights.</p>
                <p>What makes the Moon glow?
                    The Moon does not shine with its own light. It simply
                    reflects light coming from the Sun.</p>
                <p>Why does it look like the Moon is changing shape?

                    From Earth, it might look like the Moon is changing shape
                    each night – from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full
                    moon and back again. What’s actually happening is that from
                    our spot on Earth, we see different parts of the Moon lit up
                    by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit.</p>

                    alt="Mars Surface">
                <p>Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and
                    bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars, is one of
                    Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the
                    other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the
                    night sky — it looks like a bright red point of light.

                    Despite being inhospitable to humans, robotic explorers —
                    like NASA's Perseverance rover and Mars Reconnaissance
                    Orbiter — serve as pathfinders to eventually get astronauts
                    to the surface of the Red Planet.</p>
                <p>Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system,
                    and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to explore
                    the alien landscape. NASA missions have found lots of
                    evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a
                    thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.</p>
                <p>Mars remains our horizon goal for human exploration because
                    it is one of the only other places we know in the solar
                    system where life may have existed. What we learn about the
                    Red Planet will tell us more about our Earth’s past and
                    future, and may help answer whether life exists beyond our
                    home planet.</p>

                    alt="Black Hole">
                <p>A black hole is a dense, compact object whose gravitational
                    pull is so strong that nothing can escape, not even light.
                    Black holes are thought to result from the collapse of very
                    massive stars. The gravity is so strong because their mass
                    has been squeezed into a tiny space. The boundary in space
                    around a black hole is called the "event horizon." </p>
                <p>A black hole and its shadow were captured in an image for the
                    first time (2019) in a historic feat by an international
                    network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon
                    Telescope (EHT). EHT is an international collaboration whose
                    support in the U.S. includes the National Science
                    Foundation. The EHT image relied on light in radio
                    wavelengths and shows the black hole's shadow against the
                    backdrop of high-energy material around it.</p>
                <p>A black hole does not have a surface in the usual sense of
                    the word. There is simply a region, or boundary, in space
                    around a black hole beyond which we cannot see. This
                    boundary is called the "event horizon." Anything that comes
                    within a black hole’s event horizon would be consumed
                    because of the black hole’s unimaginably strong gravity.
                    Stellar black holes have the mass of a dozen or so suns, but
                    supermassive black holes, like the one first imaged by EHT,
                    have the mass of many millions of suns.</p>

                    alt="Comet">
                <p>Since ancient times, comets have fascinated sky-watchers, who
                    often considered them divine omens. A Chinese historian
                    recorded an apparition of Comet Halley as far back as 240
                    BC, describing it as a “broom star.” The Babylonians and
                    Romans also referenced the comet’s appearance, but perhaps
                    its most famous depiction is in the Bayeux Tapestry, which
                    commemorates the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The
                    tapestry shows King Harold and a crowd of fearful Englishmen
                    pointing to Comet Halley as it looms in the sky.</p>
                <p>Halley is often called the most famous comet because it
                    marked the first time astronomers understood comets could be
                    repeat visitors to our night skies. Astronomers have now
                    linked the comet's appearances to observations dating back
                    more than 2,000 years.

                    Halley was last seen in Earth's skies in 1986 and was met in
                    space by an international fleet of spacecraft. It will
                    return in 2061 on its regular 76-year journey around the
                    Sun.</p>
                <p>Comet Halley moves backward (opposite to Earth's motion)
                    around the Sun in a plane tilted 18 degrees to that of the
                    Earth's orbit. Halley's backward, or retrograde, motion is
                    unusual among short-period comets, as its greatest distance
                    from the Sun (aphelion) is beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>

                    alt="Galaxy">
                <p>Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas
                    and dust, all bound together by gravity. The largest contain
                    trillions of stars and can be more than a million
                    light-years across. The smallest can contain a few thousand
                    stars and span just a few hundred light-years. Most large
                    galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers,
                    some with billions of times the Sun’s mass.</p>
                <p>Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and
                    ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances,
                    usually dubbed irregular.

                    Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years
                    old. Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which
                    formed around 13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the
                    youngest known galaxy formed approximately 500 million years
                    ago.</p>
                <p>Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy
                    with a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years.
                    Earth is located along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms,
                    about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes about
                    240 million years to orbit the Milky Way just once.</p>

                    alt="Astronaut in Space">
                <p>The Cold War between the United States and former Soviet
                    Union gave birth to the space race and an unprecedented
                    program of scientific exploration. The Soviets sent the
                    first person into space on April 12, 1961. In response,
                    President John F. Kennedy challenged our nation “to
                    achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a
                    man on the Moon and returning him safely to earth.” It took
                    eight years and three NASA programs -- Mercury, Gemini and
                    Apollo – but the United States got to the moon.</p>
                <p>Exactly eight years, one month and 26 days after President
                    Kennedy challenged Americans to reach for the Moon, Project
                    Apollo landed the first humans on the lunar surface and
                    returned them safely to Earth. The Apollo program also
                    developed technology to meet other national interests in
                    space, conducted scientific exploration of the Moon, and
                    developed humanity’s capability to work in the lunar
                    environment. </p>
                <p>The Gemini program primarily tested equipment and mission
                    procedures and trained astronauts and ground crews for
                    future Apollo missions to the Moon. There were many goals
                    NASA had for Gemini. NASA selected “Gemini” because the word
                    is Latin for “twins,” and the Gemini was a capsule built for
                    two.</p>
